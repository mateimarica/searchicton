Welcome to Searchicton! The landmark searching mobile game for Fredericton, New Brunswick!

This is an android app and it utilizes the Google Maps API to show different landmarks in and around Fredericton! We have the locations stored on an external server, which is then downloaded and saved onto the app's local database upon startup.

We wanted to make this app to allow users to explore Fredericton in a fun way. Users can move around Fredericton using location services to play the game.
A location-based landmark app does not currently exist for Fredericton specifically. We found a few scavenger hunt apps, but they required users to create their own, without any predetermined locations. Although we take some inspiration from Pokemon Go for the game function, we are not directly improving any existing apps.

Downloading and using:
- A Google API Key is needed. In this case, the one coded in should work universally.
- Wi-Fi/Cellular Data is required upon startup to pull from the external database.
- After the first startup, only location services/GPS is required to utilize the app to its full potential. Wi-Fi/Cellular Data is used when a connection exists to check if any more landmarks were added.
